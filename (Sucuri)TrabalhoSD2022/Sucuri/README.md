# Sucuri

# Python Dataflow Programming Library

# Read the examples and the referenced papers as I do not have a written tutorial (yet).

# I am working on a completely new release of Sucuri, with distributed scheduling of tasks, 

# which will improve performance, specially in cluster environments.
